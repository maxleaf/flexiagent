# This test feeds agent with router configuration out of step1_X.cli file.
# Than it injects a number of 'sync-device' requests to test smart
# synchronization that does require VPP restart. The restart is required
# when either new interfaces is added or existing interfaces is removed in order
# to get in sync with flexiManage.
# Every injected 'sync-device' request is named a 'step'.
#   After every step test ensures that resulted VPP configuration and
# configuration database dump match the expected VPP configuration and dump.
#   As well test ensures that no fallback to full sync happend. Note in smart
# sync only affected configuration items are handled. In full sync
# the configuration is reset and all configuration items received within
# 'sync-device' request are loaded and executed.
#
# Below are steps that this test consists of:
#   step1_cfg_initial.cli - loads all kind of configuration items - interfaces,
#       tunnels, routes, applications, multilink policies, DHCP servers, etc.
#   step2_cfg_donttouch_modify_add_remove_opposite_order.cli - performs all kind
#       of possible configuration adjustments for all kinds of configuration
#       items - addition, removal, modifications, not-touching (no modifications).
#       That includes adding and removal interfaces in order to prevent vpp
#       restart. The order of configuration items (add-X requests) in
#       'sync-device' is opposite to the order sent by server usually. This is
#       subject for test, as order of synchronization is important! For example,
#       the tunnels should be removed before interfaces used by them, etc.
#   step3_cfg_donttouch_modify_add_remove_usual_order.cli - same as step 2,
#       but 'sync-device' contains configuration items (add-X) requests in order
#       which is used usually by flexiManage. It is opposite to the order in
#       step 2.
#   step4_cfg_remove_tunnels_and_one_interface.cli - the result of sync is
#       removal of tunnels and one interface only.
#       touched. We have to remove interface in order to cause vpp restart.
#       Note we have to remove multilink-policy as it might use interfaces.
#   step5_cfg_remove_interfaces.cli - the result of sync is
#       removal of all interfaces. Note we have to remove dhcp-config as well,
#       as they require LAN interface. That leaves us with applications only.
#   step6_cfg_add_interfaces_only.cli - the result of sync is addition of
#       interfaces only.
#   step7_cfg_add_tunnels_and_one_interface_only.cli - the result of sync is
#       addition of tunnels and one interface only. All the rest should be not
#       touched. We have to add interface in order to cause vpp restart.
