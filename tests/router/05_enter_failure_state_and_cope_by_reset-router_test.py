# This Test:
# 1. Causes router failure
# 2. Ensures that the failure state is recorded into file
# 3. Ensures that router rejects configuration requests in failure state
# 4. Resets the router state
# 5. Ensures that configuration requests are handled OK now
#
# The failure state is achieved by feeding agent with bad interfaces,
# when vpp is not started yet, than sending it 'start-router' request.
