# This test feeds agent with router configuration out of step1_X.cli file.
# Than it injects a number of 'sync-device' requests to test smart
# synchronization that does not require VPP restart. The restart is not required
# neither new interfaces should be added nor existing interfaces should be
# removed in order to get in sync.
# Every injected 'sync-device' request is named a 'step'.
#   After every step test ensures that resulted VPP configuration and
# configuration database dump match the expected VPP configuration and dump.
#   As well test ensures that no fallback to full sync happend. Note in smart
# sync only affected configuration items are handled. In full sync
# the configuration is reset and all configuration items received within
# 'sync-device' request are loaded and executed.
#
# Below are steps that this test consists of:
#   step1_cfg_initial.cli - loads all kind of configuration items - interfaces,
#       tunnels, routes, applications, multilink policies, DHCP servers, etc.
#   step2_cfg_donttouch_modify_add_remove_opposite_order.cli - performs all kind
#       of possible configuration adjustments for all kinds of configuration
#       items - addition, removal, modifications, not-touching (no modifications).
#       That does not include adding and removal interfaces in order to prevent
#       vpp restart. The interface modifying and not-touching are tested.
#       The order of configuration items (add-X requests) in 'sync-device' is
#       opposite to the order sent by server usually. This is subject for test,
#       as order of synchronization is important! For example, the tunnels
#       should be removed before interfaces used by them, etc.
#   step3_cfg_donttouch_modify_add_remove_usual_order.cli - same as step 2,
#       but 'sync-device' contains configuration items (add-X) requests in order
#       which is used usually by flexiManage. It is opposite to the order in
#       step 2.
#   step4_cfg_remove_tunnels_only.cli - the result of sync is removal of tunnels
#       only. All the rest should be not touched.
#   step5_cfg_add_tunnels_only.cli - the result of sync is addition of tunnels
#       only. All the rest should be not touched.
#   step6_cfg_modify_tunnels_only.cli - the result of sync is modification of
#       tunnels only. All the rest should be not touched.
